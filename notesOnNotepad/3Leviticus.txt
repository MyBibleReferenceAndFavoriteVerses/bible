10:15 = The jews do not do this anymore I bet...so you have to spiritualize it
***10:17 = JESUS PARALLEL ... The priest back then would beat the iniquitity of Israel and have to make an atonement for them ...

*** 16:20-22 = JESUS PARALLEL ... the priest is to confess everyone's sins on the scapegoat, and it shall bear all their sins and iniquities.
