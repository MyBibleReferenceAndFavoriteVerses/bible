                Summary) Joshua died and now Israel went whoring after other gods. This made the LORD mad and would not bless them. The LORD rose up judges, and it says that when the judge was there, Israel did good. But when that judge died, they went whoring again
                <br /><br />
                * 1) The angel of the LORD, he is speaking to them as he is God because he says that he will never break his covenant with you. This is also cool because it seems like he is literally there speaking with them ... As in this is Jesus

                <br /><br />
                *20-22) Ehud is a beast!!! He said "I have a message from God unto thee", so he pulled out his dagger and killed the fat King that was keeping Israel in bondage. He was so fat that when he stabbed him, he couldn't take the dagger out of his belly so he just ran
                <br /><br />

                * 12-14) This is definitely Jesus. Verse 14 says "the LORD" looked upon him. This same angel of the LORD is the same one in verse 12
                <br /><br />
                * 15) This man Gideon is the least in his Father's household, yet God chooses him and tells him that he will be a one man army against the oppresors

                <br /><br />
                * 39-40) Gideon was doubting God and having doubts in general. This man is a very righteousness man yet this is the third sign he is seeking before God. Seeing God rain down fire on the alter was not enough. This is how we humans are.
