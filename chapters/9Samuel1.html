                <br /><br />
                * 15) Ok ya, wine is definitely fine to drink lol
                <br /><br />
                20) Samuel is a really cool name because this is how he got the name Samuel

            <div class="col">
                * 1-10) SUPER powerful words from Hannah about how great the LORD is
                <br /><br />
                * 18-19) We have to name our kid Samuel, and you have to make him a linen ephod and little coat 
                <br /><br />
                27) Pretty sure this is Jesus. In the next verses he is getting mad at Eli for not getting mad at his wicked sons. 
                <br /><br />
                * 35) I think the priest he is talking about who he will raise up forever is Jesus. Actually, I think it is talking about Samuel, the next chapter talks about it I think

                * 7) It says here that Samuel did not know the LORD and the word of the LORD was not revealed unto him yet.
                <br /><br />
                * 10-11) Then the LORD came and stood, (Jesus), and talked with him 
                <br /><br />
                15) I would be scared to tell Eli that as well. That his entire history line will not be able to recieve forgiveness of sins. (Speaking non-spiritally I think)
                <br /><br />
                18) Samuel tells Eli everything, and he says "Let the LORD do unto me what seemeth good"

            <div class="col">
                18) Eli's sons died in battle. He did not really care because when the messenger told him of the news, the reason he fell back and died was because he heard that the ark of the covenant was stolen
                <br /><br />
                20) Phineas's wife who was pregnant heard about the ark and her husband, and she died after giving birth

            </div>
            <div class="col">
                *** Summary) SEE CHAPTER 6 ...  This is a really cool chapter. Nations kept passing the ark of God to other nations and they hated it because God would kill them or smite them with emerods in the secret parts. This really goes to show you how wicked these people are that they do not want to believe and worship the true and living God. They literally know that he is the right one as well it's so obvious.
                <br /><br />
                * 3) This is one of my favorite parts. The philitines set the ark of God next to their god Dagon. And in the morning, Dagon fell over and was on his face. 
                <br /><br />
                * 4) The next day, Dagon's head was cut off and his palms. This is awesome
                <br /><br />
                * 6) It says that the hand of LORD smote them and destroyed them. I think it's Jesus here. But maybe God the Father's actual hand or something.
                <br /><br />
                * 9) They carried the ark to Gath. God killed some of the men there and smote them with emerods in the secret parts

                ********** 9) NEVERMIND ABOUT IT BEING OBVIOUS THIS IS GOD. The philitines were DOUBTING that it was the hand of the LORD that did all this destruction to them. These people remind me so much of atheists it's so funny.

            <div class="col">
                2) Samuel's sons = Joel and Abiah 
                <br /><br />
                3) His sons went after money, filthy lucre. Did not judge correctly and took bribes.
                <br /><br />
                * 13) I never knew the bible goes into great detail about what women should do. This is Samuel speaking, which is a very righteous man. So it makes sense to listen to him (and God of course) here. But ya it says they are to be confectionaries, cooks, and bakers. I understand that this a bit out of context, but I see this theme throughout the bible so...
                <br /><br />
                19) Israel did not want to go with Samuel's plan, and instead wanted a king.

                Summary) Saul is introduced
                <br /><br />
                20) Samuel is the man of God, the seer, the prophet. Saul goes to find him and they end up meeting each other. Samuel being a prophet, lets Saul know that the donkeys that are missing are returned
                <br /><br />
                * 27) Samuel wanted Saul to stay a little while longer because he wanted to show him the word of God

                6) Samuel is telling Saul all the things that will happen to him shortly. And he says that he will be changed into another man ... I wonder what this could be
                <br /><br />
                9) God gave him a new heart. I am thinking this could be the indication of him getting saved. I believe this could be because he believed the words of Samuel which really were the words of the LORD.
                <br /><br />

Samson was very mad so tied a bunch of firebrands on fox's tails and let them loose to destroy resources of the Phillistines. The Phillistines were very mad so they killed the woman and her father.
                <br /><br />
                15) Samson took a donkey's jawbone and killed 1,000 men

                <br /><br />
                16) Samson literally wanted to kill himself because Dililah kept asking him where his strength was. Dang
                <br /><br />
                *** 30) Samson prays to God that he would die, along with killing all of the Philistines. Samson is obviously in Heaven. So suicide does not send someone to hell
